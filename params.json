The HibernateToDoListDAO class implements the singleton pattern.\r\nThe database (MySQL) includes the ‘items’ and ‘users’ tables. \r\nNew users can register and existing users to login/logout. In addition, the simple web application allows the users to manage their own personal todo lists.\r\nThe creation/deletion/modification were wrote in jsp files and and were designed with the use of bootstrap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
